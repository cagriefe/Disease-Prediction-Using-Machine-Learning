# Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains a robust machine learning model designed to predict diseases based on the symptoms provided by a user. The project leverages a dataset from Kaggle, which includes 132 symptoms and their corresponding diseases. The implementation involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and the use of multiple machine learning models
