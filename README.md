# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a robust machine learning model designed to predict diseases based on the symptoms provided by a user. The project leverages a dataset from Kaggle, which includes 132 symptoms and their corresponding diseases. The implementation involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and the use of multiple machine learning models including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
Model Training: Training multiple machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using k-fold cross-validation.
Ensemble Learning: Combining predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.
Visualization: Visualizing data distribution and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
