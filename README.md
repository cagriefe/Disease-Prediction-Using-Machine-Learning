# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based disease prediction system that uses symptoms to predict possible diseases. The model utilizes an ensemble approach combining Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.

# Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Multiple machine learning models implementation
- Model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation
- Ensemble learning with voting classifier
- Interactive terminal application interface for predictions
- Visualization of data distributions and model performance
